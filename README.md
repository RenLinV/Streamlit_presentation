# Streamlit presentation

What  do you need **$\color{#008B8B}{Streamlit}$** for? Well, it turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes, giving you a chance to use pure Python only. On top of that, users are not required to have any frontâ€‘end experience.
<br/>

I built [this web-app](https://apppresentation-fsmmzcx3kcvtuggxx5f4iw.streamlit.app/) using Python **$\color{#008B8B}{Streamlit}$** only. In this app, I present library itself.
