    ### Caching
    Streamlit runs your script from top to bottom at every user interaction or code change. This execution model makes 
    development super easy. But it comes with two major challenges:
    - Long-running functions run again and again, which slows down your app.
    - Objects get recreated again and again, which makes it hard to persist them across reruns or sessions.
    
    But don't worry! Streamlit lets you tackle both issues with its built-in caching mechanism. Caching stores the 
    results of slow function calls, so they only need to run once. This makes your app much faster and helps with 
    persisting objects across reruns.

    ### Add statefulness to apps
    Session State is a way to share variables between reruns, for each user session. In addition to the ability to store 
    and persist state, Streamlit exposes the ability to manipulate state using Callbacks.

    ### Working with timezones
    In general, working with timezones can be tricky. Your Streamlit app users are not necessarily in the same timezone 
    as the server running your app. It is especially true of public apps, where anyone in the world (in any timezone) 
    can access your app. As such, it is crucial to understand how Streamlit handles timezones, so you can avoid 
    unexpected behavior when displaying datetime information.
